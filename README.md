# StarshipRandomQuirks

Still to add:
- Expand hulls, power plants and weapons lists
- Add checks for tonnage limits
- Allow for customisation of attributes (crew numbers, jump range etc)
- Include random generation to aid in campaign stuffs.

# storekeeper
This is a tool to create random lists of goods available in a given store, based on store type, law level and tech level.

# ShipsLog
This is a tool for creating and working with Ships Logs. It stores them in XML format and can have multiple logs to allow for
the possibility of importing logs from other vessels for review etc.
Current WIPs:
- Sorting out the user flow, menu etc
- Making the whole tool more user friendly
- Giving more options for customising the logs and less manual typing
- Reviewing all the code
- Deciding on a better XML Schema
