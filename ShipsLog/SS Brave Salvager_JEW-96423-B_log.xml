    <description>We were unable to locate any passengers or cargo will to travel with us on Jewell,
      most of the work was already sown up by larger vessels, and that which wasn't weren't prepared
      to use an untested vessel and crew. Hopeful to find work at Emerald or we will be sunk
      quickly. I have managed to call in a favour to get the ship fuelled free of charge when we
      arrive, and the port fees waived, however that won't help us if we can't pay the mortgage and
      monthlys in a few weeks. We need to find work at Emerald.</description>
